# Calculator
A on-screen calculator created to demonstrate my knowledge in the fundamentals of Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS The Odin Project curriculum.

# Description of the project
This is a simple JavaScript-powered calculator similar to a small handheld calculator which allows users to perform simple maths operation such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

There is also an option to convert numbers into negatives and also allows user to clear all memory. Users are not able to insert more than 1 decimal point and users are not able to divide a number by 0.

# Concept learned & applied
- JavaScript Document Object Model (e.g. querySelector, classList)
- Using build in method to perform function in an array (e.g. forEach)
